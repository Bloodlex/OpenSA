# About

This repository contains a recreated Swarm Assault game in OpenRA engine. The goal of this project is to bring modern controls and quality life improvements to Swarm Assault game released in 1999 while still being faithful as much as possible to the original source material.

# Status

Currently the project still requires a lot of polishing. However you can freely play skirmishes or recreated missions (currently 80/100), feel free to give any feedback or even help to progress further the project.

# Swarm Assault vs OpenSA

Since OpenSA project is based on the OpenRA Mod SDK, it carries on a lot of quality life improvements plus additional stuff has been added to the project. Here are the key features:

- Open source,
- Multiplayer,
- Support of HD resolutions,
- Seamless zooming in and out,
- Ability to queue units,
- Rally points,
- Units no longer wander around (creep units still can do it),
- More advanced map editor with the ability of creating own missions with objectives
- Ability of adding own units to the game
- There's no random map generator in OpenSA, however the project is able to convert legacy maps to ORA format, so nothing is lost.

# How to compile/play

To launch your project from the development environment you must first compile the project by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS).  You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run your game.
