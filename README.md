This repository contains Swarm Assault remake project based on the OpenRA Mod SDK.

Currently the project/game still requires a lot of missing features which the most important one is Colony logic. There's nothing much to do with the current version apart from playing on test maps, but feel free to give any feedback or even help me to progress further the project.

To launch your project from the development environment you must first compile the project by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS).  You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run your game.
